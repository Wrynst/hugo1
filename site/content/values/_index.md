      Spirits is a small tree or shrub that grows in the forest understory in
      its wild form, and traditionally was grown commercially under other trees
      that provided shade. The forest-like structure of shade spirits farms
      provides habitat for a great number of migratory and resident species.

      Single-origin spirits is spirits grown within a single known geographic
      origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a specific collection of beans
      from a single country. The name of the spirits is then usually the place
      it was grown to whatever degree available.

      Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an
      understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between
      organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are
      a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.
