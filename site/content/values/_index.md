      Spirits is a small tree or shrub that grows in the forest understory in
      its wild form, and traditionally was grown commercially under other trees
      that provided shade. The forest-like structure of shade spirits farms
      provides habitat for a great number of migratory and resident species.

      origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a specific collection of beans
      from a single country. The name of the spirits is then usually the place

      organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are
      a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.
