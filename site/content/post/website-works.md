A challenge can serve as a dare or an exhortation, motivating a person or persons by "\[a]n invitation or summons to a trial or contest of any kind" and thus to "a difficult or demanding task, esp\[ecially] one seen as a test of one's abilities or character".\[1] In this sense, speakers or writers can use challenges to motivate - to convince people "to perform an action they otherwise \[might] not".\[2] A challenge can thus become a tool of rhetoric: a rhetorical challenge.\[3]\[4]
