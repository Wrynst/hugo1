  Here it is, the first blurb on the first post. Someday, someone will go all
  the way back to the beginning to look at these words. With that in mind, I
  will try to make the journey worthwhile!

This is the beginning of.. something.. Whether it holds any significance remains to be seen. I tend to look at things from the starting line when I reach the end of a previous chapter.  Not sure how anyone got through life holding a half empty cup. What do they have to look forward to? Seeing the bottom of a cup certainly is no motivator for me - you seen one, you've seen them all in my book.
