        You just found your ticket: Love a great flagon of gin, but never knew
        how to make one? Bought a fancy new Gin-me but have no clue how to use
        it? Don't worry, we’re here to help. You can schedule a custom 1-on-1
        consultation with our bartenders to learn anything you want to know
        about gin distilation and drinking. Email us or call the store for
        details.

        We believe that good gin has the power to bring people together. That’s
        why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting space
        where you can hang out with fellow gin lovers and learn about gin making
        techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for sale. The full
        price you pay goes to the artist.
